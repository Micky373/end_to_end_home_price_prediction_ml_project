# End to end machine learning project for house price prediction 

> In this project I have tried to do some EDA on the home price dataset and run different machine learning models to check which model gives the best solution with a good parameter. After getting the best model and saving it then I used Flask for deploying the model.

> I took the dataset from [here]('https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data) and the predicted prices of the houses are in Lakh (Hundred thousands)

## Built With

- Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
- Flask

## Getting Started

> git clone `https://github.com/Micky373/end_to_end_home_price_prediction_ml_project.git`

> cd end_to_end_home_price_prediction_ml_project

> pip install -r requirements.txt

> cd server

> python sever.py

> After the flask server is succesfully loaded go to the client directory and open the html `cd ../client`

> Then the UI will open 

> Here pass the location of the house, number of bed rooms, number of bath rooms and area then the prediction will be displayed
